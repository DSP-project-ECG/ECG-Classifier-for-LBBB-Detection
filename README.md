### Data Preprocessing
The data preprocessing step involves:
1. Removing noise from the ECG signals using a **Butterworth bandpass filter**.
2. Normalizing the signals to a standard range to ensure consistent feature extraction.

---

### Feature Extraction
Features are extracted from the preprocessed signals using **wavelet transforms**.  
Statistical features such as:
- Mean
- Standard deviation
- Skewness
- Kurtosis  
are calculated from the wavelet coefficients.

---

### Model Training and Evaluation
Various machine learning models are trained and evaluated on the extracted features, including:
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Random Forest**
- **Decision Tree**
- **Naive Bayes**

The best model is selected based on **accuracy** and other evaluation metrics.

---

### Deployment
The best-performing model (**KNN**) is deployed using a **GUI application**.  
This application allows users to:
- Input ECG signals
- Receive a classification result: **Normal** or **LBBB**
